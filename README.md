## Usage

The user must input a moonboard set (2016, 2017, or 2019) and then input an existing hold on that set (ex. "E8"). A graph will be generated showing a bar graph showing the distribution of how much that particular hold is used among existin grades.

## Data Source Acknowledgment

The MoonBoard problem data used in this project was originally sourced from a public
dataset shared by [@musoke](https://github.com/musoke) on GitHub.
